# Slidev Docker image

Work with [Slidev](https://sli.dev/). Just run following command in your work folder:

```bash
./docker_run.sh
```

If your work folder is empty, it will generate a template `slides.md` and other related files under your work folder, and launch the server on port `3030`. 

You can access your slides from http://localhost:3030/
